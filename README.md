Use Logism to open the *.circ file

This is a circuit to illustrate how the numbers 1 - 9 can be shown on a 7 segment display using a 4 bit input.

Use MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) to open the *.asm file http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/

This program will perform a number of pre-defined calculations on any two numbers.

Compile then run the program using MARS. You will first need to select option 1 to enter the first number followed by option 2 to enter the second number. Once you have done this, any of the options from 1 - 12 can be selected.

Sometimes a 0 will be displayed instead of a very large number. This is not a fault but a limitation of the simulator.
